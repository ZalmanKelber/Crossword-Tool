# Crossword Builder

View live on Github Pages [here](https://zalmankelber.github.io/Crossword-Tool/)

## Basic Description

Built in plain JavaScript (without ES6 modules) in order to allow for simple deployment on Github Pages.  Users can build a crossword puzzle template between size 3x3 and 55x55.  When a square is filled in or reopened, DOWN and ACROSS numbers are relabeled.  The following rules are enforced:

* Grid length must be odd

* Grid must have 180 degree rotational symmetry (enforced automatically when an individual square is toggled)

* Every square must be part of a vertical and horizontal answer

* Every answer must be at least three letters long

* All words must be connected (TO DO)

* (Unofficial rule): No side of the grid may be completely filled in (TO DO)

Once the user is satisfied with their grid arrangement, they can finalize it, at which point the individual squares become editable to allow for text to be entered
